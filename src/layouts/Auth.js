									HOW FANS HELP PLAYERS
								</h2>
								<p className='text-dark auth-desc-subtitle'>
									We all love our favorite school teams - but
									some
									<br /> players struggle just to pay their
									bills. Now we FANS <br /> can help{' '}
									<u>
										BY USING NEW LAWS FOR athlete NIL <br />
										(Name, Image, Likeness ), and ATHLETE
										SERVICE AS BRAND AMBASSADOR. WE FANS CAN
										BUY AN <br /> ENDORSEMENT LICENSE FROM A
										COLLEGE ATHLETE, <br /> AND EVEN FROM A
										HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE <br />
										IN SOME USA STATES (check your state).
										YOUR FAVORITE <br /> AMATEUR ATHLETE CAN
										EARN MONEY AS FHP
									</u>
									<br />
									{/* You can even participate in a call with
									athlete  */}
									BRAND AMBASSADOR AND FANS CAN GET GREAT
									DEALS!
								</p>
								<p className='text-dark auth-desc-points'>
									1- Players all get signed up right here. And
									Fans, we each find our favorite player by
									verifying via athleteâ€™s social media.
									<br />
									<br />
									2- Then a Fan buys a badge (Price as fan
									chooses - $4 to $1000).
									<br />
									<br />
									3- Fan downloads their endorsement badge and
									posts it on their social media page or
									prints badge out for framing.
									<br />
									<br />
									4- Buyer on honor system to remove badge
									from social media after license expires.
									<br />
									<br />
									5- Each dollar of price gives one week on
									license. Example, price of $4 means license
									expires after 4 weeks from purchase.
									<br />
									<br />
									6. Fan can request a call with their
									favorite athlete, as non-paid Skype call or
									a call on Pay-by-minute line to be educated
									by athlete Brand Ambassador on details of
									FHP Brand and website use.
